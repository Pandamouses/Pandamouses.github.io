# Agent Base Model
 <br>
 /<br>


## 1. Content list
This model is created to monitor wolves hunt sheep event. It simulates wolves chase the sheep, catch it and eat it.This model contains four files: GIS.py, agentframework.py agentwolf.py, and in1.txt.

- GIS.py contains code of creating sheep and wolf lists, fetching table from website which used to generize sheep and wolves location, creating a model background use data from in1.txt, wolves catching sheep function,  and creating a canvas and a menu which animates the wolves hunt sheep event. [GIS.py](GIS.py)

- agentframework.py contains code of class `Agent` which represents sheep. It includes move, eat amd share information with neighborhood functions, and code`self.alive=True` which is used to simulates whether sheep is hunted or not. If sheep is alive, then sheep can move: 
```python
        if(self.alive):
           self.x=self.move_coordinate(self.x,d)
           self.y=self.move_coordinate(self.y,d)
``` 
if the sheep is hunted, then the sheep is dead, and stop moving with color red: 
```python
         agents.alive=False
         agents.color='Red'. 
```
[agentframework.py](agentframework.py)

- agentwolf.py contains code of class `Wolf` which represents wolves. It only includes move function, but the wolves can move faster than sheep. Because in sheep:
    
 ```python 
       def move_coordinate(self,a,d):
     
          if random.random()<0.33:
              return a
          elif random.random()<0.5:
              a=(a+random.randint(1,d))%100
          else:
              a=(a-random.randint(1,d))%100
          return a 
```
   the value of d is `d = 3 `, while in wolf:
  ```python
        def move_coordinate(self,a,v):
       
          if random.random()<0.33:
              return a
          elif random.random()<0.5:
              a=(a+random.randint(4,v))%100
          else:
              a=(a-random.randint(4,v))%100
          return a
```
   the value v is `v = 50`, so wolves has a high possibility to move faster than sheep. [agentwolf.py](agentwolf.py)

- in1.txt contains raster data, each value represtents a pixel, so all the data can form a environment background. [in1.txt](in1.txt)

## 2. How to run
This model runs in python, after clicking `run file`, it will pop up a menu. And click `Model` in the menu bar, click `Run model` the model will start to run. Sheep will move randomly and wolves will move faster. There will be 3 wolves with random color **black, green** and **blue**, and all the sheep(40) are **white**. Wolves and sheep are set to move only 10 times. If sheep is within 30 unit range of wolf, the sheep would be caught and die. This is a **[screen shot](hunting.png)** of the model showing 3 dead sheep. If the model keeps running, then all the sheep are suppose to die.

## 3. Issues
The model has a bug which is in the hunting part. All the sheep will be hunted and die according to the code, but no matter setting how many iterations, only three sheep will die. Though the record in console shows multiple kills, the animation only shows three dead sheep. In order to tackle the problem, another code to determine the sheep is dead was added:
```python
        def move_coordinate(self,a,d):
          if self.color != 'Red':
            if random.random()<0.33:
               return a
```
sheep will only move if the color is not red. However, the problem still exists.
